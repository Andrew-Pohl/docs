# Fuse token

Fuse token is required to be paid to the network to approve transactions. The Fuse network is using the token to create circulation between users that look to validate transactions on the network and validators who invest computing resources and maintain it. Every block created on the Fuse chain is creating new Fuse tokens rewarded to the validators. This creates a 5% yearly inflation rate of Fuse tokens in circulation.

Fuse holders can lock it and delegate it to a validator in order to protect against inflation and get rewarded with Fuse tokens. The holders can select their favorite validator and validators are selected based on having the most delegators staking Fuse tokens.

Thus the token is used behind the scenes to align interests between all it's holders. Any holder can participate in the governance of the network by voting based on the size of his stake.

The native Fuse token is represented via an ERC-20 token on Ethereum mainnet and can be moved between the Fuse chain and Ethereum using the bridge.

| **Validation** |
| :--- |
| Token holders can stake Fuse to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K, currently 40 validators operate the network \([https://health.fuse.io/](https://health.fuse.io/)\) |
| **Voting** |
| Validtor vote on protocol changes with the staked Fuse. Which means validators with higher amounts of Fuse staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes \(until phase 2 where delegation is activated\) |
| **Fees** |
| The Fuse token is the native currency on the Fuse blockchain and is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve a transaction.  |
| **Delegation - Activated Q3 2020** |
| Delegation for token holders will be activated. This will allow any Fuse token holder to delegate their tokens to a validator to split with their rewards. Validators compete between themselves to receive delegated Fuse from token holders. Validators with the most delegated Fuse tokens are elected to validate on Fuse. |
| **Lock-up contract - Activated Q3 2020** |
| In the course of the first year after the sale users that delegate while locking their tokens for more than a year can up to double their rewards for staking. |
