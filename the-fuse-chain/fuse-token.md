# Fuse token

Fuse token is required to be paid to the network to approve transactions.

The Fuse network is using the token to create circulation between users that look to validate transactions on the network and validators who invest computing resources and maintain it.

Every block created on the Fuse chain is creating new Fuse tokens rewarded to the network validators.

This creates a 5% yearly inflation rate of Fuse tokens in circulation. 

Fuse token holders can lock it and delegate it to a validator in order to protect against inflation and get rewarded with Fuse tokens.

The holders can select their favourite validator and validators are selected based on having the minimum stake amount.

Thus the token is used behind the scenes to align interests between all its holders.

Validators can govern the network by opening votes, and holders can participate in the governance by voting \(although you need to be a validator in order for your vote to count\).

Any holder can participate in the governance of the network by voting.

[The Fuse token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x970B9bB2C0444F5E81e9d0eFb84C8ccdcdcAf84d) is an ERC-20 token which is the native token of the Fuse chain and can be moved to Ethereum using the bridge. 

Fuse tokens distributed as block reward on the Fuse chain, are minted by the bridge on the Ethereum network each cycle \(a constant number of blocks which can be changed by voting\).

All validators "sign-off" on the above process as part of their responsibilities in governing the network.

The token is traded publicly on decentralized exchanges
